# ðŸ§  Design Patterns in Python â€“ Posing Clinic Edition

This repository showcases 10 essential software design patterns using real-world concepts from a posing routine management system (e.g., bodybuilding competitions).

Each pattern is implemented in Python with a focus on clarity, extensibility, and clean architecture.

## ðŸ“š How to Use

Each file is self-contained with a `__main__` demo block. Just run:
```bash
python filename.py
